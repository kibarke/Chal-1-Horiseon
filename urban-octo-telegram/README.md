* [Horiseon Challenge](file:///C:/Users/Kirsten%20Barke/bootcamp/Challanges/Chal-1/urban-octo-telegram/Develop/index.html)

  # Overview
The website is a demonstration on the developer's knowledge of both HTML and CSS. The developer improved some of the website's design through CSS, like giving a bolder color to match the theme of the business. The develper enhanced the color of "seo" in Horiseon and added a title for when the user searches for Horiseon on a search engine, it's easier to find. The developer also included alternative text for the site's pictures, specifically the photos under Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing.

## User Story
* AS A marketing agency
* I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
* SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Goals
